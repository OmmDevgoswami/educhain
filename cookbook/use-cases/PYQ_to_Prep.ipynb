            "  A. Clear goals and objectives\n",
            "  B. Specific scope and boundaries\n",
            "  C. Measurable deliverables and outcomes\n",
            "  D. Ambiguous goals and deliverables\n",
            "Answer: Ambiguous goals and deliverables\n",
            "Explanation: A well-defined project has clear goals, a specific scope, and measurable deliverables. Ambiguity is detrimental to project success.\n",

            "Q2: What is the primary purpose of a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?\n",
            "  A. To assign resources to project activities\n",
            "  B. To identify project risks\n",
            "  C. To create a project schedule\n",
            "  D. To decompose project deliverables into smaller, more manageable tasks\n",
            "Answer: To decompose project deliverables into smaller, more manageable tasks\n",
            "Explanation: The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the project's deliverables, breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable components. This makes it easier to plan, estimate, and control the project.\n",

            "  D. Closing\n",
            "Answer: Executing\n",
